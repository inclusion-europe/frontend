        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            Ending segregation of people with intellectual disabilities is the
            core of our work at Inclusion Europe. The Together+ project
            contributes to it by providing a training for those who close down
            “care institutions”.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main objective of the Together+ projects is to create a
            comprehensive training programme focused on the management of
            deinstitutionalisation that will reflect current trends in social
            care across Europe.

            The situation of people with disabilities more generally has
            improved over time. However, this is not true for all people and
            more limited for people with intellectual and developmental
            disabilities, who are more likely to be living in segregated or
            congregated settings and less likely to be experiencing real
            inclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
            The importance of self-advocacy, self-determination and supporting
            people with disabilities to demand their rights is highlighted,
            whether at an individual level with regards to their own or at a
            local or national lobbying. People with intellectual disability are
            particularly affected by a lack of choice and control.
