One of the most popular songs is Faith by George Michael. Movie fans are treated to Die Hard or Rain Man. The World Wide Web is the topic of some conversations among experts. Russia's Soviet empire rules over much of Europe, even though its cold fingers <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_(Polish_trade_union)\">have started</a> to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing_Revolution\">lose</a> their grip. The European Union, then called the European Communities, recently welcomed Spain and Portugal among its members. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/about-erasmus/what-is-erasmus\">Erasmus</a> is 1 year old. We have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Brief_History_of_Time\">A Brief History of Time</a>.\n\nThe year is 1988, and 9 national organisations representing families of people with intellectual disabilities come together to form an organisation that would carry their work for full rights and inclusion on to the European level. They know that working together makes tackling the issues they face easier. Stereotypes, discrimination, segregation don't stop at national borders, nor do they hurt differently in different countries. Let's join forces then, they say. We can all benefit from learning about each other, sharing what works, and finding common ground around things that are hard to overcome.\n\nThat's how Inclusion Europe came to be."

Now, the child's family is much likelier to get support when the child is born. The child is likely to go to school, often to a mainstream school with non-disabled children. In many countries in 1988, this child would be taken away from their family and placed into an institution. The political and social change that allowed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.inclusion-europe.eu/parents-no-longer-have-to-hide-their-children/\">many mothers to say</a> \"No, I want to take care of my child and bring her up the best I can, just like any other parent\", was still something most people couldn't even imagine."

The fact is, in 1960 several European organisations came together for the first time to form a European organisation representing families of people with intellectual disabilities.\n\nSoon after, countries from other continents requested to join, and in 1962 the organisation became The International League of Societies for Persons with Mental Handicap (ILSMH).\n\nThe ILSMH had a 'Committee on European Affairs.'  And with the growing significance of European level policies, which was and remains a quite unique situation compared to other regions of the World, it made a lot of sense to create a separate organisation focused solely on Europe. Inclusion International and Inclusion Europe became two separate, but closely related and collaborating organisations in 1988.\n\nBack to early 1990s Europe then, where <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.inclusion-europe.eu/parents-no-longer-have-to-hide-their-children/\">things</a> are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.inclusion-europe.eu/parents-no-longer-have-to-hide-their-children/\">happening</a>; some of them <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.inclusion-europe.eu/parents-no-longer-have-to-hide-their-children/\">tragic</a>.\n\nInclusion Europe is busy bringing people and organisations together to change Europe for the better for people with intellectual disabilities.\n\n**Iain McMurray** from Scotland elected president in 1992.\n\n**John O'Gorman** from Ireland elected president in 1995.\n\n**Thérèse Kempeneers-Foulon** from Belgium elected president in 1998.\n## 2000: ILSMH-EA.

At a European conference of Inclusion International in 1985 in Hamburg, self-advocates protested the way they were being treated in the programme, and demanded equal participation. Further developments culminated in a first meeting by and for self-advocates at European level, in Durdent Court, UK, in 1997.\n\nDuring this meeting, a Steering Group of self-advocates was created to discuss establishment of a European Platform with a democratic structure. This would come true in 2000 when the European Platform of Self-Advocates was established as part of Inclusion Europe.\n## 2000: The European Platform of Self-Advocates is established as part of Inclusion Europe.\n\nInclusion Europe changes from strictly family-based organisation to a mixed organisation where both the voices of people with intellectual disabilities and of families are represented.\n\nEPSA, the European Platform of Self-Advocates, ensures our work is inclusive and accessible. EPSA also creates opportunities for self-advocates to work together and be heard at European level.\n\nEPSA appoints 3 board members of Inclusion Europe, and the chair of EPSA is vice-president of the organisation.\n\nToday, EPSA has 20 member organisations and groups from 17 countries.\n\n**Ulla Topi** from Finland becomes EPSA chairperson in 2001.\n> We want to be treated as independent human beings.\nWe want people to take our hopes and needs seriously.\nWe want our rights.\n\nUlla Topi\n## 2000: Gianina Gendelon is the first self-advocate to speak in the European Parliament.\n\nGianina spoke about what life looked like in institutions in Romania.\n## 2003: First conference of the European Platform of Self-Advocates\n\nIt was called \"Empowerment. Together against Discrimination!\"\n\nMore than 80 self-advocates and supporters from all over Europe participated at this conference in Brussels, Belgium.\n## 2005: Several new self-advocacy groups\n\nInclusion Europe worked with other organisations to support self-advocacy in Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Many people with intellectual disabilities received training to become self-advocates.

There were more than 350 participants from 27 countries.\n## Trainings for self-advocates\n\nSince 2015, Inclusion Europe organised annual trainings of European leaders of the self-advocacy movement. Self-advocates and family members can deepen their knowledge and acquire skills that help them to better advocate for their rights. These trainings were organised in Brussels, and usually connected to meetings with members of the European Parliament or other representatives of the EU.\n\nFrom 2021, trainings for self-advocates are organised at national level to support the work of self-advocates in their countries, and to strengthen their participation in national decision-making.\n## 2017: Hear our voices: Strong, Loud and Clear!\n\nThe self-advocacy conference was held alongside the European Parliament of People with Disabilities and took place in Brussels, Belgium.\n## 2019: Hear our voices in Graz - My Voice Counts!\n\n150 self-advocates from 18 countries came to the conference in Graz, Austria.

Many people died there under the harsh conditions. European Commission funded a project to change this situation, in which experts from Inclusion Europe members took part. This led to the adoption of Recommendations for Community-based Housing in 1991.\n## 1991: Inclusion Europe recommendations for community-based housing\n\nIn this document, our members commit to work towards community-based living for people with intellectual disabilities.\n\nThe language was different at the time, but the goal and approach has always been to support people with intellectual disabilities to have a good life included in the community.\n\nOur members received training on topics such as personal budgets or direct payments as a means to support person-centred services.\n## 2000: Defending human rights of people with intellectual disabilities\n\n8 Central and Eastern European countries build their capacity to better represent and defend the rights of people with intellectual disabilities thanks to our project which also covered the situation of people in institutions. As part of this work, Gianina Gendelon's testified in the European Parliament in Strasbourg about her life in Romanian institutions.\n\nIn 2002, we published 8 national reports on human rights of people with intellectual disability to reveal the situation in institutions. Ultimately, this work contributed to further advocacy and research (for example \"Included in Society\") about institutions, and the recognition of deinstitutionalisation as European issue.\n## 2004: European Coalition of Community Living\n\nSeveral European organisations started working together to promote the change from institutions to community-based support. Inclusion Europe was one of these organisations.\n\nEuropean research initiative \"Included in Society\" proved the extend of institutionalisation in almost all European countries. It gave indications about the conditions and human rights violations prevailing in institutions. The project was also the starting point for a close cooperation between many European and national disability NGOs with the aim to promote community-based services: The European Coalition for Community Living (ECCL) which was hosted during its first years in Inclusion Europe's offices.\n\nThis work would later continue within the EEG, contributing to the European Union recognising institutionalisation of people with disabilities and of children as serious issue, and changing some of its policies and funding rules.\n## 2005:  International conference on deinstitutionalisation and community living\n\nThe conference focused on the question how quality community-based services can be created, run and monitored with the strongest possible involvement of the users of these services.
